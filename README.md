### Editor for Automata - Bachelor Thesis - Raphael Bucher 2016

#### Installation
Go to this page if you are not already on it: https://github.com/RaphaelBucher/EditorForAutomata  
-> Clone or Download
-> Download Zip  
-> open runnable_Editor.jar  

#### Runs on Mac and Windows, not on Linux.
#### Executing runnable_Editor.jar requires the current Java SE Runtime Environment 8.
#### In case the file doesn't open, the Problem could be that .jar-files are not opened by the Java Runtime Environment. In this case, try:
open terminal and type  
cd directory_of_the_runnable_Editor.jar (e.g. drag and drop the Folder into the Terminal)  
java -jar runnable_Editor.jar  

Want the full eclipse-project in the repo currently for testing purpose, .gitignore will be filled out later again.
