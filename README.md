# Editor for Automata - Bachelor Thesis - Raphael Bucher 2016

## Executing runnable_Editor.jar requires the current Java SE Runtime Environment 8.
## If you still have an old Java version on your system (not recommended by Oracle), you can execute runnable_Editor_jre1.7.jar instead.
## In case the the file doesn't open, the Problem could be that .jar-files are not opened by the Java Runtime Environment. In this case, try:
open terminal and type
cd directory_of_the_runnable_Editor.jar (e.g. drag and drop the Folder into the Terminal)
java -jar runnable_Editor.jar

Want the full eclipse-project in the repo currently for testing purpose, .gitignore will be filled out later again.
